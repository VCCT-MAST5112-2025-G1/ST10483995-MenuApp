# Changelog
- First made sure that the errors from part 2 were solved
- Coded for the navigation so that it would work across all the screens
- Adjusting the work and coding that was done in Part 2 by moving and compromising some code to the other screens
- Made sure that the dishes were inputted into the arrays before moving on
- Edited the Data.tsx file to adjust to the added code with correspondence to the changes made with the arrays
- Started coding for the average prices to be dependent on the dishes added in the edit screen and shown on the view page
- Adjusting the code in specific parts to make the the ScrollView for the categories to be horizontal instead of vertical like the rest of the screens
